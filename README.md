# Kamon-Stackdriver

Kamon-Stackdriver is a library to report metrics collected by [Kamon](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon) to
[Google Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/). It supports both
[Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/) and [Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/).

### Getting Started

Add `gwidx` Bintray repository and dependencies:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("gwidx", "maven")
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "io.kamon" %% "kamon-stackdriver"         % "<version>"
  "io.kamon" %% "kamon-logback-stackdriver" % "<version>"
)
```

### Kamon Configuration
The following Kamon configuration is recommended:
```
kamon {
  metric {
    # Stackdriver accepts at most a tick every minute
    tick-interval = 1 minute
  }
  trace {
    # The Stackdriver rate limit is at a 1000 requests per 100 seconds, so
    # sending frequently isn't a problem.
    tick-interval = 2 seconds

    # Make the identifiers compatible with what Stackdriver Trace expects.
    identity-provider = "kamon.stackdriver.SpanIdentityProvider"
  }
}
```

### Logback encoder
To configure Logback so it outputs messages in Stackdriver compatible logging format add to your `logback.xml` encoder:

```xml
    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder class="kamon.stackdriver.StackdriverEncoder">
        </encoder>
    </appender>
```    
If you want to output some additional information in each log entry you can also extend `StackdriverEncoder` and use it as Encoder in the configuration:

```scala
class MyStackdriverEncoder extends StackdriverEncoder {

  override protected def extraData(event: ILoggingEvent): Map[String, String] = event match {
    case ctxAware: ContextAwareLoggingEvent =>
      val ctx = ctxAware.getContext
      ???
    case _ => Map("foo" -> "bar", "region" -> "europe-west1")
  }
}
```

### Library configuration

See `reference.conf`. In all cases the `kamon.stackdriver.metric.resource` property has to be updated to reflect for what resource
you're collecting metrics.
