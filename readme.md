#Kamon-Stackdriver

Kamon-Stackdriver is a library to report metrics collected by [Kamon](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon) to
[Google Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/). It supports both
[Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/) and [Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/).

### Getting Started

Supported releases and dependencies are shown below.

| kamon  | status | jdk  | scala            | google-cloud-monitoring | google-cloud-trace |
|:------:|:------:|:----:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
|  1.1.2 | unstable | 1.8+ | 2.10, 2.11, 2.12  | 0.46.0-beta | 0.46.0-beta

This library isn't available in as a JAR in a repository at this phase.

### Kamon Configuration
The following Kamon configuration is recommended:
```
kamon {
  metric {
    # Stackdriver accepts at most a tick every minute
    tick-interval = 1 minute
  }
  trace {
    # The Stackdriver rate limit is at a 1000 requests per 100 seconds, so
    # sending frequently isn't a problem.
    tick-interval = 2 seconds

    # Make the identifiers compatible with what Stackdriver Trace expects.
    identity-provider = "nl.markvandertol.kamonstackdriver.SpanIdentityProvider"
  }
}
```

### Library configuration

See `reference.conf`. In all cases the `kamon.metric.resource` property has to be updated to reflect for what resource
you're collecting metrics.
